# Azure Spring application series
In this series of blogs, we'll showcase Azure technologies and patterns by designing and building a simple home inventory application, which shows details about homes and their locations. 

## Premise
Applications help people and businesses accomplish tasks, as such, rather than building standalone demos, this series will focus on building an inventory management system for real estate. We'll look at using real APIs from sites to collect data about properties, neighborhoods, rentals, etc. to create a dashboard for investors that are apart of a team. 

## Series
Each blog post will be numbered to indicate the order on how this system was built. 

- Series 1: BFF based application
